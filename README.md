Code Louisville Project

My project is to try to replicate a simple restaurant site. Beyond the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it consists of the following:

*Home page <br>
*Menu page <br>
*locations page <br>

There is also a button for a modal window for reservations.

It is painfully simple, and I still needed and received a good bit of help, for which I am very grateful. Before Code Louisville, I knew nothing about coding. Looking at my site, that may still appear to be the case.

I have learned a lot, and I intend to continue learning now that some of the sorcery behind coding has been slightly demystified.
